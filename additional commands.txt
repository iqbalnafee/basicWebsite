To  create database in laravel:

We first make change in out .env file

Set this parameters:
DB_DATABASE=YOUR_DATABASE_NAME
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD= 


To create table:

	php artisan make:model Message -m

here Message is the table and -m create migration files

Here Message.php is located in the /app/Message.php 

And corresponding migration file is located in the /database/migrations

To create schema or table columns we should put our code in migrations folder's create_message_table.php table

Now put these commands

	php artisan migrate


To create entries in your message table go to your controller or where you handle your submitted inputs. In our case it
it is MessageController.php

In MessageController.php add use App\Message

To get all submitted inputs :

	$message = new Message;
	$message->name = $request->input('name'); 
	$message->email= $request->input('email'); 
	$message->message = $request->input('message'); 
	$message->save();

After creating your inputs in the database we should redirect to our homepage. to do that just add extra line
	
	return redirect('/');

If you show additional messages just put 

	return redirect('/')->with('success','message sent');


And in error message file just put these codes:

	@if(session('success'))

		<div class="alert alert-success">
		
			{{'success'}}

		</div>

	@endif
